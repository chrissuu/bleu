### About this blog

This blog is split into mainly 3 categories of posts:
1. Non-rigorous
2. Rigorous
3. Random

The **"all" tab** of this blog has *almost all* posts. The exceptions being any posts with the "**random**" tag. The **"dawn" tab** of this blog has all non-rigorous. Likewise, the **"dusk" tab** of this blog has all rigorous posts. The last tab of this blog, **fav**, has some of my favorite writing as well as all miscellaneous writing. In other words, you can find all posts you can't find in **all posts** in the **fav** tab. 

if you want to reach out, contribute a post idea, or find any bugs / typos / mistakes in my writing: make an issue to the github or email me with the header [bleu]:
