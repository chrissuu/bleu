Hi, I'm **Chris (Jin) Su**, a junior at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh, PA. This is my blog, and you can also check out my [parent webpage](https://chrissuu.com).

I enjoy a wide variety of topics, mainly: physics, mathematics, statistics, and the intersections between them. I am particularly passionate about computational complexity theory and how ideas from this field can help us understand machine learning for reasoning, randomness, and proof complexity.

### Credits
The base blog theme is a fork / clone of user rhl-bthr on GitHub's parchment repository available [here](https://github.com/rhl-bthr). The elegant footnotes style was
inspired from Simon Boehm's blog's footnote style, available [here](https://siboehm.com/).
