Hi, i'm **chris (jin) su**, a junior at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh PA.

I enjoy a wide variety of topics, mainly: physics, mathematics, statistics, and the intersections between them. 

### About this blog

I think it's easy to read an interesting problem / proof / idea and then do the ultimate disservice of not fully digesting it. The purpose of this blog is to document as many of the profound ideas I come across, as possible. 

#### **[Edit: 5/12/2025]**

When I made this blog in my freshman year, I wasn't sure what direction to take it in... should it be broad? Should it be focused? What should I talk about? I think part of the reason why I was hesitant to steer it in a certain direction was because I wasn't sure what things interested me. 

Knowing more and having taken more classes, I have a better understanding about what topics excites me: complexity theory, programming languages, logic, and artificial intelligence. 

It's not very difficult to see how deeply interconnected these topics are: programming languages and logic both analyze the syntax and semantics of expressive languages, complexity theory analyzes the limits of computation when expressiveness is introduced to a syntax, and artificial intelligence is, broadly put, the study of exploiting computational efficiency to achieve "intelligence".

I think for now, this is a healthy direction for this blog.
