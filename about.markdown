hi, i'm **chris**, a sophomore ('27) at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh PA.

i enjoy a wide variety of topics, mainly: physics, mathematics, statistics, and the intersections between them.

in the past, i have been involved with several software projects.

this blog is a mini project for one of my classes and I intend to post semi-frequently on interesting problems/puzzles/lecture notes from my classes, everyday life, or just some random things here and there that I come across!

if you want to reach out, contribute a post idea, or find any bugs / typos / mistakes in my writing, email me with the header [bleu]:
