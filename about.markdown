Hi, i'm **chris (jin) su**, a junior at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh PA. Check out the [parent webpage](https://chrissuu.com)!

I enjoy a wide variety of topics, mainly: physics, mathematics, statistics, and the intersections between them.

### About this blog

I think it's easy to read an interesting problem / proof / idea and then do the ultimate disservice of not fully digesting it. The purpose of this blog is to document as many of the profound ideas I come across, as possible. 

### Reach out!

If you want to reach out, contribute a post idea, or find any bugs / typos / mistakes in my writing: make an issue to the [github](https://github.com/chrissuu/bleu.git) or email me with the header [bleu]:
