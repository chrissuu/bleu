Hi, i'm **chris (jin) su**, a junior at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh PA. Check out the [parent webpage](https://chrissuu.com)!

I enjoy a wide variety of topics, mainly: physics, mathematics, statistics, and the intersections between them. I am particularly passionate
about computational complexity theory and how ideas from this field can help us understand the sciences, for which computation (and mathematics) is the
foundation of.

### Credits

The base blog theme is a fork / clone of user rhl-bthr on GitHub's parchment repository available [here](https://github.com/rhl-bthr). The elegant footnotes style was
inspired from Simon Boehm's blog's footnote style, available [here](https://siboehm.com/).
