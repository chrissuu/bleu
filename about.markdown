hi, i'm chris, a sophomore ('27) at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh PA.

i enjoy a wide variety of topics, mainly: physics, mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence. 

in the past, i have been involved with several software projects.

this blog is a mini project for one of my classes and I intend to post semi-frequently on interesting problems/puzzles/lecture notes from my classes, everyday life, or just some random things here and there that I come across!

i believe in academic transparency. hence, some of the posts will have the [cmu] tag, which will usually describe some cmu/job search first hand accounts.

if you want to reach out or find any bugs / typos:
