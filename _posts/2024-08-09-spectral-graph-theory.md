### Introduction
The other day, I found out that one can study graph theory or graphs under a linear algebra framework by analyzing the adjacency matrix representation of the graph. 

This post is dedicated to spectral graph theory and my attempt in trying to find some interesting results. The catch? I'm going in blind: the only thing I know about spectral graph theory is that there is a connection between graph theory and linear algebra. I have no idea what sort of theorems or ideas exist apart from this very interesting bridge between two seemingly separated frameworks. So sit back and enjoy!
