title: but, what is computation?
subtitle: introduction to logic and computation (part 2)

This is the second post in the introduction to logic and computation series (of three parts). This post will talk about computation, a "model of computation", and will be a little more abstract and mathematical than the others. However, this is NOT a rigorous introduction to computation, but rather, a semi-rigorous one so that one can still follow the important ideas without being pedantic about formalizations (kind of ironically). 

### Hilbert's Program

David Hilbert, born on January 23, 1862, was one of the most influential mathematicians to have lived. He was a polymath and made contributions to many different fields of mathematics. Hilbert had one of the most intuitive understandings of mathematics. 

In the 1920's, many mathematicians began to find inconsistencies and paradoxes in the foundations of mathematics that had been so solid, for so long. Hilbert, in specific, recognized that this was an important issue (after all, what is the point of doing any further mathematics if it is inconsistent?).

#### Some preliminary definitions

Here, I introduce some definitions that will make the further reading easier. Take your time to become familiar with them.
