**Creation**

When I was young, I really, really liked Legos. I had Star Wars sets, Ninjago sets, Technic sets, and even vintage sets that I had received as gifts from my much older cousin. What was more important to me however, was the intentional agglomeration of these: a chaotic collection of various pieces from different eras and different ideas, that I tried my best to put together elegantly. As I grew older, my interest in Legos dwindled, but my love for building grew more fiery: and I was met with the world of Minecraft! A monstrously large world (roughly 60million by 60million by ~300 blocks) sat at my fingertips, quite literally. I particularly enjoyed Minecraft's Redstone feature, which in layman's terms, allows players to create boolean logic gates and circuits (just short of turing completeness due to the lack of infinite memory), in turn, allowing for players to build rather complex contraptions such as sorting algorithms, piston doors, and various technologies. In more insignificant periods of my childhood, I consider myself lucky to have filled these with the occasional artistic inspiration: oil pastel avocados and apples, pencil portraits, crayon van Gogh, etc. Together, these instances of creation forming a well fitting portfolio of my own creativity and subconsciously reflecting my own aspirations.

**Consumption**

In highschool, I began exploring music and in particular, classical piano. I really enjoyed music from the romantic era: Chopin, Rachmaninoff, and other usual suspects. As my musicality grew, so did my appreciation for a wider range of composers such as Mozart$${}^{*1}$$, and eventually to *interpretations* of different pieces$${}^{*2}$$. Being able to enjoy certain interpretations of music over others was evidence of my growing musicality, and it certainly meant that I was able to pick up on what made a performance "good". Last semester, I took formal piano lessons for the first time in a while, but I was conflicted. What does it mean to learn how to play piano? Should I learn how to **perform** or to **play**? Is there a difference? Does "playing piano" constitute one more than the other? 

It was at this point that I came to a simple conclusion: a dilemma between being a consumer of "art" as opposed to being a creator of it$${}^{*3}$$. 

In any case, to "perform" music means to **create**, while, to "play" music means to **consume**. I "play" music because, like Legos, it was mentally stimulating and hence, fun and helped in relieving stress. But unlike my Legos, where I had a front seat in creation, I can easily say that my "playing" is not the same as "performing". While I can certainly "play" piano, I don't think I can "perform" it. For now, I am a **consumer** of music, not a **creator**. However, while most of this argument has been to acknowledge my own shortcomings of being a creator of music, I don't believe either of **creation** or **consumption** can be better a better form of experiencing a "thing" than the other. Creation and consumption serve different purposes. For me and my piano playing, to consume music means to be able to feel the music, whether through playing or through listening; To create music means to be able to show other people ***how*** to feel the music. 

**Exploration**

In college and hopefully long into the far future, I want to be learning and experiencing. While I began drafting this post believing that creation and consumption were the only two facets one should be concerned with when thinking about how to approach the many experiences in life, I forgot the very thing that perpetuates and allows for these to take place in the first place: **exploration**!

How is **exploration** different from **consumption**? Exploration is a broader, overarching term that tries to answer the question, "what experiences are out there?", while **consumption** tries to answer the question, "what experiences do I want to *keep* having?". The act of **consuming** a "thing" implies that you've experienced this "thing" before. Then, the act of **creation** tries to answer the question, "*how* can I share this experience with others?". Perhaps, in a sense, if life is a collection of memories and experiences, then the following are also true:
1. **Creation** concerns the human identity in relation to sharing memories and experiences.
2. **Consumption** concerns the human identity in relation to picking and choosing past memories and experiences to re-experience.
3. **Exploration** concerns the human identity in building a personal index of the available memories and experiences that can be gathered as a result of being conscious. 

#### Reflections
This blog post was initially drafted several months ago, after I began to think deeply about what it means to experience. More precisely, I wondered why people bought expensive clothing, why people liked to eat at Michelin-starred restauraunts, why people like to create art, why people visit museums, etc. I don't think I'll ever truly be able to answer these questions, but this post was a start. My own experiences led me to create biases and subconsciously, prejudices (whether 'good' or 'bad') about people that did certain things, in certain ways. When I lay it out formally like this, I can better reason through my own biases and prejudices, and realize something intrinsic and foundational to human nature: the ability to experience and appreciate experiences. 

Albeit, the title for this post is a little brazen, but perhaps many things can be bucketed into these three ideas!



#### Footnotes
<sub><sup>$${}^{*1}$$ Some might suspect that I did not like Mozart here, and while this was certainly true, I regrettably wish that I had listened to more Mozart when I was younger. Today, I can easily say that I have found an appreciation for Mozart. </sup></sub>

<sub><sup>$${}^{*2}$$ To the non-musical people here, you might have always wondered why it's interesting for musicians to listen to various different people play the same piece. After all, a composer writes music, the musician follows it... right? Not quite. A musician's job is to take a composer's music and "interpret" it. Like how literary scholars of today decompose Shakespeare and put it back together, musicians do something similar, except for music, resulting in really different perspectives on the same sheet of music. </sup></sub>

<sub><sup>$${}^{*3}$$ Here, I use "art" as a general term that fits the following definition: **anything that can be created and consumed.** I really like this definition (I'm not sure if someone else had established this definition in the past but for now it's my own) because it is broad enough to capture the essence of art. By this definition, mathematics is art, because people can both consume math (solve well established problems) and create math (research). Most mathematicians would argue that mathematics itself is a form of art, so no contradiciton here. </sup></sub>
