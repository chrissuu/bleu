### Introduction
>"Everything that is hard to attain is easily assailed by the generality of men." - **Claudius Ptolemy**

In the mid 1500s, Copernicus proposed a revolutionary theory that challenged existing notions regarding the movement of the cosmos: heliocentricism. 

Existing notions, conceived in religious support and a human reliance on intuition, resulted in strong beliefs that Earth existed at the center of the universe. Everything, in God's observance, would revolve around the Earth. It was Copernicus whose theory helped propel astronomy towards a more beautiful model of the universe that observed scientific thinking, logic, and rigor. 

### The Nature of Proof
>"Plausible, or even 'trivially true' propositions are usually soon refuted: sophisticated, implausible conjectures, matured in criticism, might hit on the truth." - **from** [Proofs and Refutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_and_Refutations)
