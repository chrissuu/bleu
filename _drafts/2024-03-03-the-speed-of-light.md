Maxwell's equations are the foundation of modern classical electromagnetism theory and for good reason! They accurately describe electromagnetic phenomena!

They are typically introduced as the set of four equations (PDE's):


(1) $$\nabla \cdot \textbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$


(2) $$\nabla \cdot \textbf{B} = 0$$ 


(3) $$\nabla \times \textbf{E} = -\frac{\partial\textbf{B}}{\partial \text{t}}$$ 


(4) $$\nabla \times \textbf{B} = \mu_0(\textbf{J} + \epsilon_0\frac{\partial\textbf{E}}{\partial \text{t}}$$
